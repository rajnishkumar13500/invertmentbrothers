      <h1>INVESTMENT PROCESS

</h1>
	  <br>
	  <h6>Create a policy statement</h6>
<p>The investor has to primarily draft a policy statement which should contain the investor's
goals and constraints relating to investments. This is certainly the most important step in the
portfolio management process. The policy statement requires the investor to consider his true
financial needs, both in the short run and the long run. It helps to guide the investor in
meeting his needs. In case of market uncertainty or a change in investor's needs, the policy
statement will help to guide the investor in making the necessary adjustments in the portfolio
in a disciplined manner
The major objectives include current income, capital appreciation, safety of the principal etc.
He needs to prioritize these objectives based on his needs.
In addition, he has to also understand the constraints arising from the investments such as
liquidity, time-horizon, tax etc.
</p>
	  <h6>Choice of an asset mix</h6>
<p>This is the most important decision that the investor needs to take in the investment process.
This decision is concerned with the proportion of ‘stocks’ and ‘bonds’ in the portfolio. The
term ‘stocks’ include equity and equity related investments like mutual fund, ULIPs etc.
‘Bond’ includes investment in fixed income bearing securities like debentures, Government
bonds, Corporate bonds etc. An appropriate ‘stock-bond’ mix is vital component of
investment decision, which depends on various factors like risk tolerance, investment
horizon, current income v/s capital appreciation etc.
</p>


 <progress value="0" max="10" id="progressBar"></progress><div id="countdown"></div>

<h6>Develop an investment strategy</h6>
<p>This entails creating a strategy that combines the investor's goals and objectives with current
financial market and economic conditions. There are basically two strategies available,
namely, active portfolio strategy and passive portfolio strategy. In an active portfolio
strategy, the investor tries to earn superior risk-adjusted returns through market timing, sector
rotation, securities selection and so on. On the contrary, passive investment strategy aims to
hold a diversified portfolio and maintain a pre-determined level of risk-exposure.

</p>
<h6>Selection of securities</h6>
<p>The investor plays the most important role in selection of securities. He may select from his
own wisdom or borrow the ides from the experts. The investor shall undertake fundamental
analysis and technical analysis to select ‘stock’ related securities. In case on ‘bond’ related
securities, he shall consider yield-to-maturity, credit rating, term-to-maturity, tax shelter,
liquidity etc.
</p>

<h6>Portfolio execution
</h6>
<p>This entails putting the investment strategy to work, investing in a portfolio that meets the
investor’s goals and constraints. This is the practical step, where the investor tries to buy the
securities or sell the specified securities in given amounts. This is an important decision that
shall have an impact on the investment results.

</p>	

<h6>Portfolio revision
</h6>
<p>Both markets and investors' needs change as time changes. As such, it is important to monitor
for these changes as they occur and to update the plan to adjust for the changes that have
occurred. The portfolio value and the portfolio composition may change, subject to change in
the values of stocks and bonds. Hence, there could be a need for shift form stocks to bonds or
bonds to stocks, stock rotation, security switches etc. 
</p>	  
<h6>Performance Evaluation
</h6>
<p>A periodical survey of the portfolio performance is quite essential in the investment process.
The key factors to be considered are risk and return of the portfolio. The investor needs to
check if the returns are in line with the underlying risk. This review shall enhance the quality
of the entire process and must be undertaken on a continued basis. 
</p>	  
  
	  
	 

<h4>SAVINGS AND INVESTMENT
</h4>
<p>
Investors make money out of money. They don’t have to work hard because their money is
working for them. We are past the traditional life, where the company or the government had
guaranteed a pension for the old age. It is time for everyone to plan their retirement and
investments in a systematic manner.
Robert Kiyosaki (2000) in his famous book “Cash Flow Quadrant: Rich Dad’s Guide to
Investing” is of the opinion that people are tuned to the conditional life, where they are taught
to go to school, obtain good grades and then to secure a safe job. This thought is Industrial
Age thinking and has become obsolete. He further clarifies that today we live in an
information age and it would be wiser to condition ourselves and our children into thinking –
Going to school, getting good grades, build business, and become a successful investor.
Since money has been the pivotal factor of all human activities, the thirst to earn money has
been from times immemorial. Savings and Investments are some of the most important
monetary action tools to make money. The investor tries to apply all his skills, knowledge
and expertise in managing his money to get the maximum benefit for the investment.
One of the most important assumptions that underline the study of investments is that the
investors behave in a rational manner. But, many academic researchers have questioned the
full rationality. Monika Aggarwal and Amit Baruah (2012) attempted to analyze the silver commodity as an
investment option and have tried to establish the relationship in gold, silver, platinum and
palladium. The average returns for the silver for a time period of 1813 – 2010 is 2.28%, with
a minimum of 0.25% and a maximum of 21.79% per annum. The study also reveals that the
risk in silver prices is low as compared to gold, platinum and palladium.  </p>
<br>

<p>
G Jayabal and R Kasilingam (2011) found that the investor’s preferred source of information
was newspaper, followed by TV/Radio, Expert Opinion, Friends/Colleagues, Magazines,
Investment Consultant, Brokers/Agents and Relatives. They have further discovered that the
information source used is having impact on range of awareness, choice criteria, expected
return and savings motive.
Mohit Gupta and Subhash Chander (2011) have discovered that there is a significant
difference between retail and non – retail mutual fund investors with respect to factors of
advertisement and shows and published articles,; while former is more important for the retail
investors, the latter is more important for the non – retail investors. The study further
concludes by assuming that there is more importance in the sense that all advertisements and
TV shows regarding mutual funds should be more oriented towards retail investors.
Hakan Ozerol, Selin Metin Camgoz, Mehmet Baha Karan, Azize Ergeneli, (2011) in their
study have investigated adaptive and maladaptive effects of certain demographic variables
like age, gender, education and marital status and the trading strategies like portfolio value,
turnover ratio, investment period, consulting advice, number of stocks in the portfolio,
percentage of stock investments on trading performance of individual investors. The study
has revealed that the investors who have less amounts of portfolio value and turnover rates,
have tendency to outperform the market and thus exhibit superior performance. Also, the
study concludes that the investors who are outperforming the market are the ones with highly
educated, relying on the recommendations of experts and women in gender.   
</p>

<h3> RISK – RETURN RELATIONSHIP</h3>
<p>
Risk can be defined as the probability that the actual returns of a security deviates from the
expected return.
There is a positive relationship between the amount of risk assumed in managing a portfolio
of securities and the amount of expected return. In very general terms, the greater the risk, the
larger the expected return and vice-versa.
The investor who is ready to take greater risks shall be compensated with higher returns. An
investor with moderate risk would get moderate returns and the investor who is risk-averse
and takes very little risk shall get only lesser returns. Hence the degree of risk taking ability
shall determine the level of returns.
A strategy has to be built which attempts to balance risk versus reward by adjusting the
percentage of each asset in an investment portfolio according to investor’s risk taking ability,
financial goals and investment time horizon. Investors always expect a good rate of return from their investments. Rate of return could be
defined as the total income the investor receives during the holding period stated as a
percentage of the purchasing price at the beginning of the holding period.

</p>
<h6>Risk</h6>
<p>Risk of holding securities is related with the probability of actual return becoming less than
the expected return. Investment’s risk is just as important as measuring its expected rate of
return because minimizing risk and maximizing the rate of return are interrelated objectives
in the investment management.
An investment whose rate of return varies widely from period to period is risky than whose
return that does not change much. Every investor likes to reduce the risk of his investment by
proper combination of different securities.</p>

<h6>Safety</h6>
<p>The selected investment avenue should be under the legal and regulatory frame work. If it is
not under the legal frame work, it is difficult to represent the grievances, if any. Approval of
the law itself adds flavor of safety. Even though approved by law, the safety of the principal
differs from one mode of investment to another.
</p>
<h6>Liquidity</h6>
<p>Marketability of the investment provides liquidity to the investment. The liquidity depends
upon the marketing and trading facility. If a portion of the investment could be converted into
cash without much loss of time, it would help the investor meet the emergencies. Stocks are
liquid only if they command good market by providing adequate return through dividends
and capital appreciation.
</p>


	 
<p>
Abhijeet Chandra and Dinesh Sharma (2010) found that there are five main cognitive biases
namely, over confidence, conservatism, representativeness, under/over opportunitism and
excess sensitivity to rumours does influence the investor’s behaviour and decision making.
Rationality in Investments has always been a contradictory talk. Rationality hereby refers to
two main factors, namely, the exhaustive and objective treatment of available potential
information. Investors are supposed to be perfectly rational and supposed to make investment
decisions objectively using all the available and useful information. In real financial
paradigm, some irrational investor’s reactions has been identified; these irrational reactions
deviate investors from making rational decisions.
R Kasilingam and G Jayabal (2010) in their study have classified the investors into three
categories, namely, Rational Investors, Normal Investors and Irrational Investors. The study
reveals that that both the rational and normal investors give high importance to risk protection
which means around 74% of investors will not go to equity market where there is a high risk
component in capital market, due to market fluctuations.
Syed Tabassum Sultana (2010) in her study has observed that male investors dominate the
investment market in India. She has also found that the investors possess higher education
like graduation and above of which, majority of them relate to financial and accounting
related employment. She could also observe a particular investment habit amongst the
investors.A wide study is made with regard to investor’s investment behaviour and pattern. P
Balasubramanian and Dr. R Ganesan (2009) found that there are certain factors that
influence the investment behaviour and pattern amongst which, capital gains and dividends
are the most important ingredients. Few other factors would be nature of industry, expected
earnings, dividend polarity, price volatility, liquidity, growth prospects and EPS.
There are many interesting attributes amongst the savings behaviour of Indian households. It
is considered that in a developing economy, majority of household savings are parked in
financial assets rather than physical assets. On the contrary, in India, household savings are
almost equally distributed between physical and financial assets. Many studies have been
carried out to find out whether Indians are habituated with a high degree of thrift, they are not
ready to invest in financial assets, particularly in capital market securities.
Swarnankur Chatterjee, Michael Finke and Nathaniel Harness (2009) have found that
individual financial decision is often influenced by higher self-esteem. Those with high level
of self-esteem generally invest in risky assets and have the motivation to enhance self image
through wealth accumulation. It is also possible that those with greater self-esteem are overconfident and destroy wealth through sub-optional trading behaviour. The study also
concludes that a lack of self-esteem can be a significant barrier to long-run financial success. 

</p>
  <h3> INDIVIDUAL INVESTOR LIFE CYCLE</h3>
  <p>Financial plans and investment needs are as different as each individual. Investment needs
change over a person’s life cycle. The investment plan should consider the investor’s age,
financial status, future plan, risk aversion characteristics, needs etc.
Before embarking on an investment program, the investor needs to make sure that his three
important needs are satisfied, viz,
 Adequate income to cover living expenses and
 Safety net in case the unexpected could occur
 Cash Reserve

Cash Reserve is quite important to help meet the contingencies and emergencies like job
layoffs, unforeseen expenses, emergence of good investment opportunities, safety cushion
etc. The proportion of cash reserves should also change over the life cycle of the investor.
Assuming that the basic insurance and cash reserve needs are met, individuals can start a
serious investment program with their savings. Due to the changes in net worth and risk
tolerance levels, the individual investor’s investment strategies will change over their life
time. Following is the Individual Investor’s Life Cycle,
