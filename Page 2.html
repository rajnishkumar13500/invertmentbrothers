	  <p>Savings and Investments form an integral part of one’s life. Investments refer to the
employment of funds with an objective of earning a favourable return on it. In other words,
investment is a process, where money is being utilized with a hope of making more money.
Investment is the commitment of money that have been saved by deferring the consumption
and purchasing an asset, either real or financial with an expectation that it could yield some
positive future returns.
There is a plethora of investment avenues, each associated with varied risk-return trade-offs.
Every investment avenue is distinct in its characteristic, which makes the investment decision
fascinating. The investor thus needs to carefully analyze each of its characteristics and build a
basket of assets that suits his risk profile and complies with his objectives and goals. Hence,
investment decision making is a fascinating task to the investor.
There are different categories of investors. The investment strategies differ from each other,
with regard to size of the investment, time-period, objectives, risk appetite etc.
</p>
<h6>The investors
can be classified into</h6>
<ul>

<li>Individual investors</li>
<li>Corporate</li>
<li>Institutional investors – Domestic and Foreign</li>
<li>Pension Funds</li>
<li>Government</li>
</ul>

<p>
The Indian economy is growing at a faster pace, which has resulted in higher disposable
income level and a plethora of investment avenues. There are numerous options like,
Government savings deposits, banks, NBFCs and mutual fund houses are vying for a share in
the savings of investors. Investors now have wide-ranging options for making investments
like equity, debt, mutual funds, gold etc. (Kathuria 2012 : 45-56).
Investment is defined as a commitment of funds made in the expectations of some favourable
rate of return. If the investment exercise is properly undertaken, the return will be
corresponding with the risk the investor assumes. (Fischer 2008 : 2)
Investment is an acquisition of a financial product or other item of value with an anticipation
of favourable future returns. Investing is a serious subject that can have a major impact on
investors’ future well-being. Investors have series of investment avenues and each of them
differ in terms of risk, return, safety, security, regular income and various other parameters.
The investor has to choose proper investment avenue, depending upon his specific need, risk
preference and expected returns. (Kothari 2013 : 476-480)
Investment has got two attributes – time and risk. The sacrifice takes place in the present and
is certain. The reward to be received in future is generally uncertain. In some cases, the time
element dominates, as in case of government securities. Either time or risk or both are
important. (F Sharpe W et al. 1996)
Investment decision-making process is concerned with how an investor should proceed in
making a decision about what marketable securities to invest in, how extensive an investment
should be and when the investment should be made. Investment is a sacrifice of current
rupees for future rupees.
Investors’ investment pattern has witnessed a metamorphic change and this change can be
attributed to changing scenario of investment alternatives available. Investors have started
investing more in modern financial products like equity, mutual funds, ULIPs than the
ordinary financial product like term deposits, post office deposits, etc. (Warne 2012 : 1)
The challenges confronted by the investors are taking right investment decisions. The varied
investment opportunities poses a challenging questions to the investors, like, why, where,
how, how much and when to invest. Hence investment involves complex decision making
process with regard to choosing the investment avenue with the expectation of returns with or
without making thorough analysis. The return on such investment depends on investor’s
preferences towards various investment avenues, his ability to take risk and also his
demographic characteristics. (Gabhane 2013 : 44-48)
The concept of savings plays an important role in an economy. In Indian context, the preindependence period has witnessed people spending most of their income on consumption
and a very less portion of income being saved. After independence, the major objective of the
Government was promotion of savings and capital formation, which are engines of growth.
There has been a consistent increase in the national savings rate in India through the postindependence period. (Athukorala 2004 : 491-503)

<h3> INTRODUCTION TO SAVINGS</h3>
<p>
Savings are of great importance in a developing country like India. The quantum of these
savings has a direct bearing on the level of economic activity of the nation. The degree of
progress attained in a country largely depends on what the households do with the additional
income generated every year. There is a certain need for adequate integration of savings and
investment programmes into development strategies that are capable of improving resource
allocation, promotion of equitable distribution of income and reducing vulnerability.
There are various challenges in the savings behaviour of the Indian households. The sluggish
economy, steep market declines, deteriorating revenues, alarming reports of scandals, insider
trading, illegal corporate accounting practices etc have posed few challenges in savings
pattern. In an emerging economy like India, majority of the savings are parked in financial
assets rather than real or physical assets. The role of savings and investments and its impact on macro-economic factors have raised
controversies amongst economists. While few economists argued that excess savings could
lead to depression, other economists were against this argument. Adam Smith refuted the
opinion and argued that savings could lead to economic growth. In the wealth of nations,
Smith maintained that, “As the capital of an individual can be increased only by what he
saves from his annual revenue or annual gains, so the capital of society, which is the same
with that of all individuals who compose it, can be increased in the same manner....... what is
annual saved is as regularly consumed as what is annually spent, and nearly at the same time
too; but it is consumed by a different set of people” (1937, p 123).
According to classical theory of savings and investment, the key factor that would bring
savings and investment into equilibrium at full employment is the interest rate. In other
words, an increase in savings would lead to decrease in the interest rates and this would cause
an increase in investment and thus stimulate growth. Keynes challenged the classical theory and argued in his work Keynes General Theory that,
“The traditional analysis has been aware that savings depend on income but it has overlooked
the fact that income depends on investment, in such fashion that, when investment changes,
income must necessarily change in just that degree which is necessary to make change in
savings equal to the change in investment” (1936, p 184). He also stated that ‘”increased
investment will always be accompanied by increased saving, but it can never be preceded by
it” (1939, p 572). Further, Keynes sated that, “The investment market can be congested on
account of a shortage of cash. It can never be congested on account of saving” (1973, p 222).
In contrast, the supply-determined growth theory suggests that savings determine investments
and hence, any economic policy should be aimed at increasing the private savings which
would result in lower interest rates and which, in turn, would increase investments. </p>

<h3> INTRODUCTION TO INVESTMENTS</h3>
<p>
Post-second world war, economic growth has received considerable attention by economists,
who raised the question of whether growth is determined by aggregate demand or aggregate supply. In the demand-determined growth theory, investment determines savings through
multiplier effect and that it plays a crucial role in determining the growth rate of productivity.
In contrast, the supply-determined theory suggests that savings determines investment and
therefore the direction of any economic policy should be, at the very least, to increase the
amount of private savings which would result in lower interest rate and which, in turn, would
increase investment. (Amirkhalkhali 1990)
Investments and portfolio decisions are taken within the framework provided by a complex of
financial institutions and intermediaries which together comprise the capital market. It is this
market which provides the mechanism for channelizing current savings into investment in
productive facilities, i.e., for allocating the country’s capital resources among alternative
uses. In effect the financial market provides an economy’s link with the future, since current
decisions regarding the allocation of capital resources are a major determining factor of
tomorrow’s output. The crucial role played by the financial markets in shaping the pattern
and growth of real output imparts a social significance to individual investment and portfolio
decisions.
Investment strategy is so different from the hundreds or perhaps thousands of other strategies.
The reason for differentiation is its unique blend of both traditional and modern investment
concepts, and its focus on the individual investor. It is equally important to understand the
criteria used by the investors to evaluate any investment and make decision.Today, the investor lives in a more complex and contradictory world than before. Making
money is not easier. At the same time, holding on to it, has never required more ingenuity.
Taxes, inflation, a stop-and-go economy, a mind-boggling array of investments, the high cost
of “expert” advice, all create a formidable obstacle course to investment success.
To make matters still more perplexing, technology has finally begun to turn investing into a
science. Research Centres are continuing to pile up important new findings about
investments. But, because of the limited mathematical expertise, few investors or
professionals can benefit from these results. Indeed, faculties at many business schools
remain unaware of the results. 
</p>

<h3> SAVINGS AND INVESTMENTS</h3>
<p>
It is quite important to understand the different motives of savings and investments. The
difference lies in the key element that synchronized both savings and the investments.
According to classical theory approach, the key element is the interest rates. In other words,
interest rates shall synchronize motivation to save with motivation to invest by assuming that
both savings and investments are functions of interest rate. On the contrary, according to
Keynesian theory, motivation to savings is mostly independent of interest rates and depends
heavily on the level on income and behavioural and institutional factors. 
With respect to investment, classical economists emphasize interest rate as the main
determinant of investment. They argue that investment is highly interest rate elastic as
investors are mainly concerned with the cost of borrowing. On the other hand, the Keynesian
view accepts that investment may respond to movements in the interest rates, but emphasize
that such a responsiveness of investments to interest rate is very low as compared to the role
of economic conditions or state of confidence.
Hence, it can be learnt that savings and investment decisions are generally made by different
groups and for different reasons and the markets do not quickly coordinate savings and
investments. Appropriate economic policies need to be implemented to guide the economy
towards the optimum level of savings and investments.
Higher savings ratios are associated with higher investment ratios. Of the survey made
amongst the seven countries for a period of 1960-87, Japan enjoyed the highest average ratios
for both savings (0.364) and investments (0.316). The USA had the lowest ratios for both
savings (0.186) and investments (0.152). In terms of variability, the USA showed the smallest
standard deviation for both savings (0.015) and investments (0.009). The largest variability
was observed for savings ratio in Italy (0.043) and for investment ratio in Germany (0.025).
